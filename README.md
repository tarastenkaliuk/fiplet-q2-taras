Q2 - Templating, DOM manipulation and data processing

Youâ€™ve been tasked with creating an online RSS display service.

Implement functionality to load and switch between various RSS feeds
Implement functionality to load each RSS feed only once (until the page reloads)
Implement functionality to paginate the RSS feed with up to 5 posts per page
Implement UI for loading and error states
For bonus points, ensure a smooth UX when switching quickly between feeds on a slow connection and show good use of Promises

You must not use reactive frameworks such as Vue.js or React. You can use templating libraries such as Handlebars in combination with Vanilla JavaScript or jQuery for DOM manipulation. You are also recommended to use the following libraries, but you can use your preferred libraries or Vanilla JavaScript if you wish.

jQuery: AJAX, event handling and DOM manipulation
Handlebars: Templating
moment.js: Timestamp processing and formatting
lodash: Data processing and manipulation
